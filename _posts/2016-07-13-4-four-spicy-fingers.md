...impressions of 8 days and 7500 Km

Driving through the US verified that stereotypical image of what I always thought road trips in North America would look like, for the most parts anyway. Once we passed Oregon's snowy mountains, we faced one endless road disappearing into the horizon. The only thing that changed was the vegetation, the scenery and the easily recognizable approach into the next town when signs of Mac Donald and Walmart emerged on the roadside - with some exceptions off course. I am probably exaggerating, but throw the odd ghost town into the mix and the overall impression is pretty much that. The unknown road offered plenty of food for discussions, discoveries and some laughs along with some worries and excitement. A good mix!

For example one town we had aimed for to fuel up, turned out to only have one gas station and that station was de-commissioned years ago. I guess that gave us the opportunity to test our 20-litre jerry can and then pray it'll take us far enough to the next pump. Next stop we bought a second jerry can..... just to be safe.

Then there were the wind-gust warnings in some areas of Nevada. We saw a few semi-trailers laying on their sides and that made us question how our Snorkel mobil would react - specially when the radio kept announcing "vehicles with trailer are prohibited'. We decided what we were towing with our little van, wasn't really worth calling a trailer compared to those huge campers and the semi trucks we saw surviving on the road coming towards us (with, off course, those few exceptions but are the odds?). We really didn't feel like we offered too much surface for the wind to attack - but when those gusts hit us, it felt like that moment on top of the roller coaster where your stomach lurches as the cart tips forward. Probably dramatizing now - but with utter concentration and quick reflexes we steered against those, what felt like immense forces, and we survived.

It was amazing to see how many different looks the desert has. Just take rocks and their formations for example - the ever changing shades and layers of colour and variations of shapes are endless. And vegetation - there are plants found only in one area and then no more. Add the different weather patterns to the various landscapes and the drama is complete, form mysterious to majestic - from powerful to ancient.

That stayed true once we entered Mexico, only that the towns we passed through displayed more history, colonial and modern architecture. The odd and also funny things we'd see, increased the wealth of new impressions of a country we had only seen little of in our lives..... for example how unrestricted (and in what condition) vehicles would transport just about anything you can imagine.

The road conditions themselves here also triggered some awe and oh's and ouches. We found the various Mexican states must distribute their available funds quite differently. Some seem to feel the roads are not really a priority (even when road toll is being collected), while others invest so much that the driving experience is close to surpassing the quality and safety standards of roads back home.

The van overheated once (only) on the incline up into the mountains as we were trying to beat dusk. It was a bit scary because everyone had advised us "do not drive at night". So, as we were forced to stand on the side of the highway, we grew a little nervous while the engine cooled down (from a red hot glow) and the darkness slowly rolled in. Once ready again, the coolant was topped up and the drive continued on high alert, slow and steady, aiming at staying in the wind-shadow of trucks. For two reasons - A) if anything was on the road we could hit (cows, dogs, donkeys) the truck surly would clear the way first and B) those truckers knew the roads well and they would slow down for obstacles such as topes and/or potholes, so we could easily follow suit. We found a place in Puebla that night.

We arrived in Merida 2.30pm on January 28th. Our A/C had conked out about 1-1/2 hours before we reached the city and we had every crack the vehicle would offer, wide open to maximize airflow. We drove straight through to Chelem (located by the ocean), where Jess had booked an Air B&B for the week - which didn't work out. By the time we had that sorted, drove back for take-out food on some parking lot and finally our realtor saving our behinds providing her empty apartment in Merida Centro, it was late in the evening. We all crashed in our beds, the fans running on highest settings and the dogs on the cool tiles. One last chilled little Coronita and we fell asleep wondering what the next day would bring. We did it, we were in Merida!!!
