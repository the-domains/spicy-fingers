# (1) Spicy Fingers

...nope, this is not a cooking site. This is where we write about our Mexican adventures.

We first fell in love with Merida on the Yucatan peninsula in early 2015 and over the course of that year decided to live in Mexico for the year to come. We left Roberts Creek in December and drove the 7500km trip down to Mexico in our 'Snorkel Mobil' with our 2 kids, 2 dogs and a little trailer in tow. This is our story.
