  We started to plan around investing into some real estate in Mexico end of
  2014. Call it retirement planing or midlife crisis, it doesn't really matter.
  What matters is that our exploration to maybe expand our investment beyond the
  increasingly unaffordable real-estate market in BC, has evolved into an
  adventure for the whole family and possibly the most interesting endeavour we
  have dove into. Naturally we were convinced we’ll write about this trip,
  always wanted to write a blog. After all, we had many friends who cared to
  know what we were up to and asked us to share - but till now we never really
  got there (other than FaceBook posts). I guess we weren’t really sure what we
  had to say would be something of any value, probably doubted if anyone really
  cared other than us and some close friends. Both, Jess and I are fairly
  private in nature and sharing things on a broader scale meant to accept the
  inevitable comments and criticism on that same larger scale. We have to be at
  ease with our own writing style and with sharing our views of the world, as we
  see it, despite some readers possibly judging us for it. We decided we are
  alright with that. Ergo here we are, after now 5-1/2 months in the Yucatan, we
  finally decided to start posting.
