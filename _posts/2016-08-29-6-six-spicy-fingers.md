  Its the first Sunday after my family left for Vancouver for a month. I get
  into the kitchen to make coffee and the all too familiar sight of the tropics
  stares into my face. A cockroach is sitting on the coffee machine waiving his
  antennas at me. Initially I get annoyed but then I recognize the opportunity!
  I am tasked with feeding my sons pets while he is away. This roach will make
  for a good meal, so I move onto catching it. That bastard is fast but with
  empty yogurt container at hand and repeatedly moving stuff around as this
  ‘thing’ keeps hiding, luring some nasty swear words out of me, I caught him.
  He was dropped into the enclosure containing the two lovebird scorpions. Who
  is swearing now?

### Learning from the young

Its the first Sunday after my family left for Vancouver for a month. I get into the kitchen to make coffee and the all too familiar sight of the tropics stares into my face. A cockroach is sitting on the coffee machine waiving his antennas at me. Initially I get annoyed but then I recognize the opportunity! I am tasked with feeding my sons pets while he is away. This roach will make for a good meal, so I move onto catching it. That bastard is fast but with empty yogurt container at hand and repeatedly moving stuff around as this 'thing' keeps hiding, luring some nasty swear words out of me, I caught him. He was dropped into the enclosure containing the two lovebird scorpions. Who is swearing now?

With my coffee in front of me, waves crashing outside under the sun, I am thinking time for a quick "blog"..... about the critters? Why not? So here a little bit about my sons passion.

In very early years it was dinosaurs, then it naturally evolved to amphibians and now its arachnids. You'd think they are all kinda in the same ball park - think again. The salamanders and frogs in our pond he saved every year, successfully fed and released back into the wild after the heat of summer are a far cry from the tarantulas and scorpions we have crawling around here now..... and what the heck is an amblypygi anyway (the spell check doesn't even know)? We have witnessed scorpions having tiny babies, the fascinating molting process of each of these animals and many merciless feedings, everything multiple times.

In the meantime we have grown not only fond of these critters but proud because our son has carried this interest of his to levels, where we actually come to realize this could become a career. Not just the study of the beast itself, no! He is talking venom studies in respect to cancer research and spontaneous limb regeneration in regards to helping amputees. That's some powerful stuff coming from a 15 year old.

When a parent in kindergarden once asked the kids what they want to become when they grow up and received responses like policeman, nurse and fireman, our son confidently announced he wants to be a palaeontologist...

...I had no clue what that even was!

I always knew we would learn from our children but this was not what I had envisioned at the time.
