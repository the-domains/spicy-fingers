I get into the kitchen to make coffee and the all too familiar sight of the tropics stares into my face. A cockroach is sitting on the coffee machine waiving his antennas at me. Initially I get annoyed but then I recognize the opportunity! I am tasked with feeding my sons pets while he is away. This roach will make for a good meal, so I move onto catching it. That bastard is fast but with empty yogurt container at hand and repeatedly moving stuff around as this ‘thing’ keeps hiding, luring some nasty swear words out of me, I caught him. He was dropped into the enclosure containing the two lovebird scorpions. Who is swearing now?</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="57"><p>With my coffee in front of me, waves crashing outside under the sun, I am thinking time for a quick “blog”….. about the critters? Why not? So here a little bit about my sons passion.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="58"><p>In very early years it was dinosaurs, then it naturally evolved to amphibians and now its arachnids. You’d think they are all kinda in the same ball park - think again. The salamanders and frogs in our pond he saved every year, successfully fed and released back into the wild after the heat of summer are a far cry from the tarantulas and scorpions we have crawling around here now….. and what the heck is an amblypygi anyway (the spell check doesn't even know)? We have witnessed scorpions having tiny babies, the fascinating molting process of each of these animals and many merciless feedings, everything multiple times.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="59"><p>In the meantime we have grown not only fond of these critters but proud because our son has carried this interest of his to levels, where we actually come to realize this could become a career. Not just the study of the beast itself, no! He is talking venom studies in respect to cancer research and spontaneous limb regeneration in regards to helping amputees. That’s some powerful stuff coming from a 15 year old.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="60"><p>When a parent in kindergarden once asked the kids what they want to become when they grow up and received responses like policeman, nurse and fireman, our son confidently announced he wants to be a palaeontologist…</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="61"><p>…I had no clue what that even was!</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="62"><p>I always knew we would learn from our children but this was not what I had envisioned at the time.</p></div></div><div class="Group

class="font-title " href="4-four-spicy-fingers" data-reactid="135">...impressions of 8 days and 7500 Km</a></span></h3></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="136"><p>Driving through the US verified that stereotypical image of what I always thought road trips in North America would look like, for the most parts anyway. Once we passed Oregon’s snowy mountains, we faced one endless road disappearing into the horizon. The only thing that changed was the vegetation, the scenery and the easily recognizable approach into the next town when signs of Mac Donald and Walmart emerged on the roadside - with some exceptions off course. I am probably exaggerating, but throw the odd ghost town into the mix and the overall impression is pretty much that. The unknown road offered plenty of food for discussions, discoveries and some laughs along with some worries and excitement. A good mix!</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="137"><p>For example one town we had aimed for to fuel up, turned out to only have one gas station and that station was de-commissioned years ago. I guess that gave us the opportunity to test our 20-litre jerry can and then pray it’ll take us far enough to the next pump. Next stop we bought a second jerry can..... just to be safe.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="138"><p>Then there were the wind-gust warnings in some areas of Nevada. We saw a few semi-trailers laying on their sides and that made us question how our Snorkel mobil would react - specially when the radio kept announcing “vehicles with trailer are prohibited’. We decided what we were towing with our little van, wasn’t really worth calling a trailer compared to those huge campers and the semi trucks we saw surviving on the road coming towards us (with, off course, those few exceptions but what are the odds?). We really didn’t feel like we offered too much surface for the wind to attack - but when those gusts hit us, it felt like that moment on top of the roller coaster where your stomach lurches as the cart tips forward. Probably dramatizing now - but with utter concentration and quick reflexes we steered against those, what felt like immense forces, and we survived.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="139"><p>It was amazing to see how many different looks the desert has. Just take rocks and their formations for example - the ever changing shades and layers of colour and variations of shapes are endless. And vegetation - there are plants found only in one area and then no more. Add the different weather patterns to the various landscapes and the drama is complete, form mysterious to majestic - from powerful to ancient.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="140"><p>That stayed true once we entered Mexico, only that the towns we passed through displayed more history, colonial and modern architecture. The odd and also funny things we’d see, increased the wealth of new impressions of a country we had only seen little of in our lives..... for example how unrestricted (and in what condition) vehicles would transport just about anything you can imagine.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="141"><p>The road conditions themselves here also triggered some awe and oh’s and ouches. We found the various Mexican states must distribute their available funds quite differently. Some seem to feel the roads are not really a priority (even when road toll is being collected), while others invest so much that the driving experience is close to surpassing the quality and safety standards of roads back home.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="142"><p>The van overheated once (only) on the incline up into the mountains as we were trying to beat dusk. It was a bit scary because everyone had advised us “do not drive at night”. So, as we were forced to stand on the side of the highway, we grew a little nervous while the engine cooled down (from a red hot glow) and the darkness slowly rolled in. Once ready again, the coolant was topped up and the drive continued on high alert, slow and steady, aiming at staying in the wind-shadow of trucks. For two reasons - A) if anything was on the road we could hit (cows, dogs, donkeys) the truck surly would clear the way first and B) those truckers knew the roads well and they would slow down for obstacles such as topes and/or potholes, so we could easily follow suit. We found a place in Puebla that night.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="143"><p>We arrived in Merida 2.30pm on January 28th. Our A/C had conked out about 1-1/2 hours before we reached the city and we had every crack the vehicle would offer, wide open to maximize airflow. We drove straight through to Chelem (located by the ocean), where Jess had booked an Air B&amp;B for the week - which didn’t work out. By the time we had that sorted, drove back for take-out food on some parking lot and finally our realtor saving our behinds providing her empty apartment in Merida Centro, it was late in the evening. We all crashed in our beds, the fans running on highest settings and the dogs on the cool tiles. One last chilled little Coronita and we fell asleep wondering what the next day would bring. We did it, we were in Merida!!!</p></div></div><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 d-ib" data-reactid="144"><a class=" " href="4-four-spicy-fingers" data-reactid="145"><div class="Cover ov-h"

Call it retirement planing or midlife crisis, it doesn't really matter. What matters is that our exploration to maybe expand our investment beyond the increasingly unaffordable real-estate market in BC, has evolved into an adventure for the whole family and possibly the most interesting endeavour we have dove into. Naturally we were convinced we’ll write about this trip, always wanted to write a blog. After all, we had many friends who cared to know what we were up to and asked us to share - but till now we never really got there (other than FaceBook posts). I guess we weren’t really sure what we had to say would be something of any value, probably doubted if anyone really cared other than us and some close friends. Both, Jess and I are fairly private in nature and sharing things on a broader scale meant to accept the inevitable comments and criticism on that same larger scale. We have to be at ease with our own writing style and with sharing our views of the world, as we see it, despite some readers possibly judging us for it. We decided we are alright with that. Ergo here we are, after now 5-1/2 months in the Yucatan, we finally decided to start posting.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-4cc6ca53-7218-439d-aec7-a3fd7eeacdb7" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="271"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="272"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="273"><a class=" " href="3-three-spicy-fingers" data-reactid="274"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="275"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="276"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/36da00fb5ada1de814e79d9c8b2b36f8/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F68968aca-a9e1-404c-aaaf-aa785544775f.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:50.048828125% 78.3203125%;" data-reactid="277"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/37d05c9593a8324d40d040540f0b15fa/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F68968aca-a9e1-404c-aaaf-aa785544775f.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:50.048828125% 78.3203125%;" data-reactid="278"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/82bd99d7589c40e578ab25ba008bcbe7/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F68968aca-a9e1-404c-aaaf-aa785544775f.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:50.048828125% 78.3203125%;" data-reactid="279"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/209e230c245bfb28935fd7779586a8ac/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F68968aca-a9e1-404c-aaaf-aa785544775f.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50.048828125% 78.3203125%;" data-reactid="280"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="4000" data-height="3000" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/36da00fb5ada1de814e79d9c8b2b36f8/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F68968aca-a9e1-404c-aaaf-aa785544775f.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:50.048828125% 78.3203125%;" data-reactid="281"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="282"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="283"><h1 data-reactid="284"><span class="" data-reactid="285"><a class="font-title " href="3-three-spicy-fingers" data-reactid="286">(3) three Spicy Fingers</a></span></h1></div><div class="System-font " data-reactid="287"><h3 data-reactid="288"><span class="" data-reactid="289"><a class="font-title " href="3-three-spicy-fingers" data-reactid="290">...crossing over</a></span></h3></div><!-- react-empty: 291 --><!-- react-empty: 292 --><!-- react-empty: 293 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="294"><p>Our first border crossing from Canada into the US was surprisingly more eventful than anticipated. Not that we expected to fly through but after being instructed to park at the customs &amp; immigration area, we had to leave the car keys with 2 officers outside for them to search our vehicle and trailer. Once inside, the officer behind the counter felt our agenda was too out of the norm and was joined by a second officer for them to wrap their heads around what we had laid out as our one year plan. Both officers fired questions at us clearly aimed at investigating wether or not we would somehow disappear in the United States and find work there. They couldn't fathom the fact that we were planning a trip for that length of time and that our destination was Mexico, not the United States. Additionally, that we had no definite route or places planned to stay at on our way down, bypassing the US altogether, really took them for a loop. After repeatedly being asked and telling them our final destination, we then spelled ‘Merida’ out, as well as answered what we did for a living for the border officers to google away and confirm that we didn't make any of this up. By that point, it more likely than not, was out of curiosity. The 2 officers then joined the 2 that had our car keys. All 4 then went through our car and trailer again, before coming back inside with more questions as to why we would expose our children to the dangers of Mexico and have we ever been there before? We said ‘yes, multiple times” before finally, in a friendly manner, asking back; have you been? The answer was “no and as border officers, knowing what we do, we would never consider a trip down”. The conversation now had lost the interrogation factor and became somewhat casual. We were filled in what kind of information patrol officer would receive about Mexico’s border areas. Why what we are doing all seemed so dangerous and irresponsible to them. It all made sense to us from their point of view. Interestingly enough we have European friends who apply the same logic to areas in the US they wouldn't visit after watching the news.</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="295"><p>All officers conducted their tasks in a respectful and professional manner and by the time we were done the whole experience was a pleasant one, despite us initially being surprised that we were such an anomaly. Probably because by then, we had read so many news, blogs and become members of FaceBook groups over the past year, all of which shared many fun, fearless and safe trips in &amp; around Mexico. So we felt that should be something normal. But as we have come to learn there are many truths and we had ours, our European friends theirs and the boarder patrol theirs.</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="296"><p>…and all the paperwork and documents we had prepared for our dogs to cross the border legally, were not even asked for once.

Just like the officers at the US border crossing, most of us would never consider exposing ourselves to the risks of kidnaping and street robbery willingly. Hence, when we shared our plans they were met with some concern. Even now that we have been here for a good while we get comments from people back in Canada and Europe. In conversation with some of these very rational folks we couldn't really hand out the “it just feels right” card, so it helped collecting an inventory of some facts and viewpoints we had gathered throughout our research period and now, while experiencing this wonderful country.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="311"><p>Statistics are hard to use as main anchor but still seem to be a good starting point. It probably was a good idea to look at different types with a variety of angles. That way we covered not only our preferred version of the truth, but getting a good spread of the puzzle, more or less. We arrived at the conclusion that Mexico is safe - actually very safe - and the Yucatan in particular, is in many respects safer than Canada or the States. Naturally every place has areas that are safer and others that are not so much. But even as best informed as we can to avoid possible dangers, how could we be sure? Heck, haven't you heard, these days you can get caught in the middle of a shooting in Langley and need to be careful in Richmond because of the home invasions, or Vancouver with its increase in road rage. In Vancouver 1991, a man was gunned down 2 houses down, on the street, the first night I moved there. For all I had read about Vancouver, it was suppose to be such a safe city and locals had told me the area I chose to live in was very safe…. I wasn't so sure after than night anymore. Hence my statement, statistics are not really a bullet proof approach. Tragedy can hit anytime, anywhere and if you let yourself be scared all the time you’ll never leave the house….</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="312"><p>I personally quite like the; “If he or she can do it, so can I” approach. That’s somewhat how I started Nico Spacecraft. I asked more experienced woodworkers and designers how they ran their businesses and they’d tell me. You’ll be surprised how helpful people are when you ask. This simple but very effective way of research not only provided us with tons of useful info but also lead us to meet some very interesting people from all shades of life and countries (and still does). Some had traveled the whole land, some the world before coming here. Many have lived in Mexico for many years and run successful businesses. Everyone has stories, shares experiences and has advice.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="313"><p>As for the local Mexican folks, people are generally open, curious, honest and very helpful. I am guilty of initially being suspicious and burdened with prejudice, only to stand corrected almost every single time. There are some local dynamics though one wants to be aware of and needs to get used to. We will probably cover those in later posts….</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="314"><p>We kept coming across the phrase “Use common sense!”. What is that even? A 6th sense or a broader recognition of things based on experience, or both? I can’t talk about others but Jess and I both have traveled a lot in our lives and feel connected to our ‘common sense’. It seems to be fairly clear to us when to deviate, abort or when to follow through, even if it could get uncomfortable. I really don't want to jinx this here but so far we have been blessed with great experiences.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="315"><p>I find Social Media can be the most helpful or the most dangerous thing…. ya gotta be able to use it properly and read between the lines, being thorough and applying that famous common sense again when reading what people have to say. There are those who feed into the fear, then there are the newcomers who somehow know it all (oh crap, I just realized - I hope we don't sound like them), then there are the long-timers that share tons of information (almost too much sometimes) and off course there is everyone in between. The worst, I feel, are the ones who come into another country and expect everything to be like back home and complain when it is not. Don’t listen to that group because, in my opinion, they tend to use the wrong parameters to base their judgement on. Truth be told though, in general there are some great forums, discussion and Facebook groups which provide a wealth of insightful information.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="316"><p>….and then there is that moment when you realize you are NOT the only ones traveling with two kids and two dogs in a country a lot of people think is high-risk. It feels kinda reassuring when there are other “crazies” out there who realized Mexico is much, much safer than mainstream media makes it out to be. Its a wonderful country which, with the right attitude, will enrich a travellers life tremendously.</p></div></div><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 d-ib" data-reactid="317"><a class=" "

Not that we expected to fly through but after being instructed to park at the customs & immigration area, we had to leave the car keys with 2 officers outside for them to search our vehicle and trailer. Once inside, the officer behind the counter felt our agenda was too out of the norm and was joined by a second officer for them to wrap their heads around what we had laid out as our one year plan. Both officers fired questions at us clearly aimed at investigating wether or not we would somehow disappear in the United States and find work there. They couldn't fathom the fact that we were planning a trip for that length of time and that our destination was Mexico, not the United States. Additionally, that we had no definite route or places planned to stay at on our way down, bypassing the US altogether, really took them for a loop. After repeatedly being asked and telling them our final destination, we then spelled ‘Merida’ out, as well as answered what we did for a living for the border officers to google away and confirm that we didn't make any of this up. By that point, it more likely than not, was out of curiosity. The 2 officers then joined the 2 that had our car keys. All 4 then went through our car and trailer again, before coming back inside with more questions as to why we would expose our children to the dangers of Mexico and have we ever been there before? We said ‘yes, multiple times” before finally, in a friendly manner, asking back; have you been? The answer was “no and as border officers, knowing what we do, we would never consider a trip down”. The conversation now had lost the interrogation factor and became somewhat casual. We were filled in what kind of information patrol officer would receive about Mexico’s border areas. Why what we are doing all seemed so dangerous and irresponsible to them. It all made sense to us from their point of view. Interestingly enough we have European friends who apply the same logic to areas in the US they wouldn't visit after watching the news.","title":"(3) three Spicy
