Call it retirement planing or midlife crisis, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. What matters is that our exploration to maybe expand our investment beyond the increasingly unaffordable real-estate market in BC, has evolved into an adventure for the whole family and possibly the most interesting endeavour we have dove into. Naturally we were convinced we’ll write about this trip, always wanted to write a blog. After all, we had many friends who cared to know what we were up to and asked us to share - but till now we never really got there (other than FaceBook posts). I guess we weren’t really sure what we had to say would be something of any value, probably doubted if anyone really cared other than us and some close friends. Both, Jess and I are fairly private in nature and sharing things on a broader scale meant to accept the inevitable comments and criticism on that same larger scale. We have to be at ease with our own writing style and with sharing our views of the world, as we see it, despite some readers possibly judging us for it. We decided we are alright with that. Ergo here we are, after now 5-1/2 months in the Yucatan, we finally decided to start posting.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-medium

data-reactid="95">Our first border crossing from Canada into the US was surprisingly more eventful than anticipated. Not that we expected to fly through but after being instructed to park at the customs &amp; immigration area, we had to leave the car keys with 2 officers outside for them to search our vehicle and trailer. Once inside, the officer behind the counter felt our agenda was too out of the norm and was joined by a second officer for them to wrap their heads around what we had laid out as our one year plan. Both officers fired questions at us clearly aimed at investigating wether or not we would somehow disappear in the United States and find work there. They couldn&#x27;t fathom the fact that we were planning a trip for that length of time and that our destination was Mexico, not the United States. Additionally, that we had no definite route or places planned to stay at on our way down, bypassing the US altogether, really took them for a loop. After repeatedly being asked and telling them our final destination, we then spelled ‘Merida’ out, as well as answered what we did for a living for the border officers to google away and confirm that we didn&#x27;t make any of this up. By that point, it more likely than not, was out of curiosity. The 2 officers then joined the 2 that had our car keys. All 4 then went through our car and trailer again, before coming back inside with more questions as to why we would expose our children to the dangers of Mexico and have we ever been there before? We said ‘yes, multiple times” before finally, in a friendly manner, asking back; have you been? The answer was “no and as border officers, knowing what we do, we would never consider a trip down”. The conversation now had lost the interrogation factor and became somewhat casual. We were filled in what kind of information patrol officer would receive about Mexico’s border areas. Why what we are doing all seemed so dangerous and irresponsible to them. It all made sense to us from their point of view. Interestingly enough we have European friends who apply the same logic to areas in the US they wouldn&#x27;t visit after watching the news.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="96"><p data-reactid="97">All officers conducted their tasks in a respectful and professional manner and by the time we were done the whole experience was a pleasant one, despite us initially being surprised that we were such an anomaly. Probably because by then, we had read so many news, blogs and become members of FaceBook groups over the past year, all of which shared many fun, fearless and safe trips in &amp; around Mexico. So we felt that should be something normal. But as we have come to learn there are many truths and we had ours, our European friends theirs and the boarder patrol theirs.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="98"><p data-reactid="99">…and all the paperwork and documents we had prepared for our dogs to cross the border legally, were not even asked for once.

Just like the officers at the US border crossing, most of us would never consider exposing ourselves to the risks of kidnaping and street robbery willingly. Hence, when we shared our plans they were met with some concern. Even now that we have been here for a good while we get comments from people back in Canada and Europe. In conversation with some of these very rational folks we couldn&#x27;t really hand out the “it just feels right” card, so it helped collecting an inventory of some facts and viewpoints we had gathered throughout our research period and now, while experiencing this wonderful country.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="112"><p data-reactid="113">Statistics are hard to use as main anchor but still seem to be a good starting point. It probably was a good idea to look at different types with a variety of angles. That way we covered not only our preferred version of the truth, but getting a good spread of the puzzle, more or less. We arrived at the conclusion that Mexico is safe - actually very safe - and the Yucatan in particular, is in many respects safer than Canada or the States. Naturally every place has areas that are safer and others that are not so much. But even as best informed as we can to avoid possible dangers, how could we be sure? Heck, haven&#x27;t you heard, these days you can get caught in the middle of a shooting in Langley and need to be careful in Richmond because of the home invasions, or Vancouver with its increase in road rage. In Vancouver 1991, a man was gunned down 2 houses down, on the street, the first night I moved there. For all I had read about Vancouver, it was suppose to be such a safe city and locals had told me the area I chose to live in was very safe…. I wasn&#x27;t so sure after than night anymore. Hence my statement, statistics are not really a bullet proof approach. Tragedy can hit anytime, anywhere and if you let yourself be scared all the time you’ll never leave the house….</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="114"><p data-reactid="115">I personally quite like the; “If he or she can do it, so can I” approach. That’s somewhat how I started Nico Spacecraft. I asked more experienced woodworkers and designers how they ran their businesses and they’d tell me. You’ll be surprised how helpful people are when you ask. This simple but very effective way of research not only provided us with tons of useful info but also lead us to meet some very interesting people from all shades of life and countries (and still does). Some had traveled the whole land, some the world before coming here. Many have lived in Mexico for many years and run successful businesses. Everyone has stories, shares experiences and has advice.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="116"><p data-reactid="117">As for the local Mexican folks, people are generally open, curious, honest and very helpful. I am guilty of initially being suspicious and burdened with prejudice, only to stand corrected almost every single time. There are some local dynamics though one wants to be aware of and needs to get used to. We will probably cover those in later posts….</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="118"><p data-reactid="119">We kept coming across the phrase “Use common sense!”. What is that even? A 6th sense or a broader recognition of things based on experience, or both? I can’t talk about others but Jess and I both have traveled a lot in our lives and feel connected to our ‘common sense’. It seems to be fairly clear to us when to deviate, abort or when to follow through, even if it could get uncomfortable. I really don&#x27;t want to jinx this here but so far we have been blessed with great experiences.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="120"><p data-reactid="121">I find Social Media can be the most helpful or the most dangerous thing…. ya gotta be able to use it properly and read between the lines, being thorough and applying that famous common sense again when reading what people have to say. There are those who feed into the fear, then there are the newcomers who somehow know it all (oh crap, I just realized - I hope we don&#x27;t sound like them), then there are the long-timers that share tons of information (almost too much sometimes) and off course there is everyone in between. The worst, I feel, are the ones who come into another country and expect everything to be like back home and complain when it is not. Don’t listen to that group because, in my opinion, they tend to use the wrong parameters to base their judgement on. Truth be told though, in general there are some great forums, discussion and Facebook groups which provide a wealth of insightful information.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="122"><p data-reactid="123">….and then there is that moment when you realize you are NOT the only ones traveling with two kids and two dogs in a country a lot of people think is high-risk. It feels kinda reassuring when there are other “crazies” out there who realized Mexico is much, much safer than mainstream media makes it out to be. Its a wonderful country which, with the right attitude, will enrich a travellers life tremendously.</p></div></div><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 d-ib" data-reactid="124"><div class="Cover
