<p>For some reason mainstream media seems to love picking on Mexico with reports and stories which, if I didn't know any better, would keep me from even considering a trip there. Just like the officers at the US border crossing, most of us would never consider exposing ourselves to the risks of kidnaping and street robbery willingly. Hence, when we shared our plans they were met with some concern. Even now that we have been here for a good while we get comments from people back in Canada and Europe. In conversation with some of these very rational folks we couldn't really hand out the “it just feels right” card, so it helped collecting an inventory of some facts and viewpoints we had gathered throughout our research period and now, while experiencing this wonderful country.</p><p>Statistics are hard to use as main anchor but still seem to be a good starting point. It probably was a good idea to look at different types with a variety of angles. That way we covered not only our preferred version of the truth, but getting a good spread of the puzzle, more or less. We arrived at the conclusion that Mexico is safe - actually very safe - and the Yucatan in particular, is in many respects safer than Canada or the States. Naturally every place has areas that are safer and others that are not so much. But even as best informed as we can to avoid possible dangers, how could we be sure? Heck, haven't you heard, these days you can get caught in the middle of a shooting in Langley and need to be careful in Richmond because of the home invasions, or Vancouver with its increase in road rage. In Vancouver 1991, a man was gunned down 2 houses down, on the street, the first night I moved there. For all I had read about Vancouver, it was suppose to be such a safe city and locals had told me the area I chose to live in was very safe…. I wasn't so sure after than night anymore. Hence my statement, statistics are not really a bullet proof approach. Tragedy can hit anytime, anywhere and if you let yourself be scared all the time you’ll never leave the house….</p><picture>

<p>I personally quite like the; “If he or she can do it, so can I” approach. That’s somewhat how I started Nico Spacecraft. I asked more experienced woodworkers and designers how they ran their businesses and they’d tell me. You’ll be surprised how helpful people are when you ask. This simple but very effective way of research not only provided us with tons of useful info but also lead us to meet some very interesting people from all shades of life and countries (and still does). Some had traveled the whole land, some the world before coming here. Many have lived in Mexico for many years and run successful businesses. Everyone has stories, shares experiences and has advice.</p><p>As for the local Mexican folks, people are generally open, curious, honest and very helpful. I am guilty of initially being suspicious and burdened with prejudice, only to stand corrected almost every single time. There are some local dynamics though one wants to be aware of and needs to get used to. We will probably cover those in later posts….</p><picture>

<p>We kept coming across the phrase “Use common sense!”. What is that even? A 6th sense or a broader recognition of things based on experience, or both? I can’t talk about others but Jess and I both have traveled a lot in our lives and feel connected to our ‘common sense’. It seems to be fairly clear to us when to deviate, abort or when to follow through, even if it could get uncomfortable. I really don't want to jinx this here but so far we have been blessed with great experiences.</p><picture>

<p>I find Social Media can be the most helpful or the most dangerous thing…. ya gotta be able to use it properly and read between the lines, being thorough and applying that famous common sense again when reading what people have to say. There are those who feed into the fear, then there are the newcomers who somehow know it all (oh crap, I just realized - I hope we don't sound like them), then there are the long-timers that share tons of information (almost too much sometimes) and off course there is everyone in between. The worst, I feel, are the ones who come into another country and expect everything to be like back home and complain when it is not. Don’t listen to that group because, in my opinion, they tend to use the wrong parameters to base their judgement on. Truth be told though, in general there are some great forums, discussion and Facebook groups which provide a wealth of insightful information.</p><p>….and then there is that moment when you realize you are NOT the only ones traveling with two kids and two dogs in a country a lot of people think is high-risk. It feels kinda reassuring when there are other “crazies” out there who realized Mexico is much, much safer than mainstream media makes it out to be. Its a wonderful country which, with the right attitude, will enrich a travellers life tremendously.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="34"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="36"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="37"><span data-reactid="38"><!-- react-empty: 39 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="40"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="41">(5) five Spicy Fingers</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="42"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="43"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="44"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
